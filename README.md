This is a demonstration of my ability to solve some Project Euler problems.

I'll solve the first five from scratch, and test them using testing suites.

To go above and beyond, I'll also include answers to some harder Project Euler problems that I solved on another occasion (namely, the 1.5 hour Project Euler Spring on 2015.9.24).  Just less official `p`-type tests for those, however.
